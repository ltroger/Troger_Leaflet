This map highlights the disparancy between gas/fuel stations and electrical charging stations. As electrical vehicles get more commonly used, the need for charging stations is ever increasing. This map should also show people where these power stations are located so they can make use of them. The data used is from Overpass-Turbo, where I used 2 queries to determine both of these values.
The design is kept simple, with 2 colours that are recognisable, even for people with colour blindness. I chose circles, instead of markers, to make the two values more easily differentiable. The overall map should show the users the locations and make him compare the values with each other, which is why the only information that is shown on mouse hover is the name of the establishment. Should the user want to find out more about the value, he can click on the circle and find out more about it, such as what type of outlet is used or when it is open for business. The map could be improved, by displaying the total numbers of gas stations and charging stations, to further highlight the difference between the two.
